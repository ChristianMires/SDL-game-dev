Process for game programming (as I understand)

Main Method:
int main( int argc, char* args[] );
 1. Perform all necessary initialization via init() method.
 2. Load all media necessary via loadMedia() method.
 3. Enter main loop. Includes all input updates and window updates.
 4. After loop is complete, safely close the program and return 0.

Initialization Method:
int init();
Within the initialization method "init()", you must perform all library initializations such as "SDL_Init()" and "IMG_Init()".
 1. Initialize SDL.
 2. Create main window.
 3. Initialize image loading.
 4. Get window surface.

Media Loading Method:
int loadMedia();
Within the loading method "loadMedia()", all image loading for the program is completed. I suspect that this will change as we move onto larger games with more strenuous rendering requirements.
 1. Set loading success flag.
 2. Load all surfaces with custom "loadSurface( std::string path )" method.
 3. Return success flag.
